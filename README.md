# Black-Scholes-Merton Calculator

This is a Python implementation of the Black-Scholes-Merton model for calculating the prices of European call and put options. The model takes in the following inputs:

- Current stock price (S)
- Option strike price (K)
- Standard deviation per year in percent (sigma)
- Risk-free interest rate (r)
- Time until expiration in days (t)

The script then uses the Black-Scholes-Merton formula to calculate the prices of European call and put options.

## Installation
To use this script, you need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download and install Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

In addition, you need to install the scipy package, which can be installed using pip.

## Inspiration
This script was inspired by the Corporate Finance Courses offered at Link√∂ping University. The courses provided a comprehensive introduction to financial instruments and valuation methods, including the Black-Scholes-Merton model. The knowledge gained from these courses inspired me to develop this script as a way to apply the concepts I learned to real-world financial problems. I hope this script can be useful for others who are interested in financial modeling and analysis.

## Credits
The Black-Scholes-Merton formula was developed by Fischer Black, Myron Scholes, and Robert Merton in 1973. This script is based on their original work and other implementations of the formula in Python.
